Docker compose files needed to setup a Ghost blog with SSL (courtesy of Let's Encrypt).

Adapted from Alex Gallacher's blogposts ([part 1](https://alexgallacher.com/how-to-setup-nginx-ssl-on-docker/) [part 2](https://alexgallacher.com/how-to-setup-ghost-with-nginx-and-lets-encrypt/))

For Ghost and SSL, only the ghost and proxy directories are needed. The google-proxy is an additional, optional proxy for Google Analytics to bypass ad blockers.
